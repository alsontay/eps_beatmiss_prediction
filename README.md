To directly replicate report results without going through long run times, these are the recommended files to run: <br>
1.4.1 EDA + Combining of Datasets for Alpha = 0.2 <br>
2.1.7 Stacking Classifier, with SMOTE and Alpha Dataset Variants <br>
3.1.1 Backtesting Code <br>

For Data Collection <br>
1.0 Code to Select the top 100 Trending Stocks from Reddit <br>
